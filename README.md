# Advent of Code 2020
Solutions for Advent of Code 2020. Also includes a basic website that shows some graph representations of a private leaderboard.

All of this year's problems have been completed! 25 JavaScript solutions and 1 C++ solution for day 15 since that one was quite slow in JS. (The C++ solution for day 23 only works for part 1).
